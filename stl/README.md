# STL Files for 3D Printing Camera Mounts

In this directory there are STL files for 3D printing the camera mounts.

I used Blender to create the files in this folder, and fair warning, I have zero idea what I'm doing when it comes to 3D modeling. 

I had to scale this model file, to 41% for 3D printing on my Prusa i3 MK2. I used PLA, and hot glued velcro on to the side where I mounted my camera.

This works for both my Raspberry PI v2 camera, and my Logitech HD webcam. 

## Mounting onto Your Camera

The idea with this design is that we have 1" holes we can 3D print modules for. 

Each of these modules then fits into the 1" hole, and expands the capabilities of the deep learning camera.

For now there's just a camera mount, but later versions will include food dispensers and interactive buttons for birds/crows.
